After some point within innovation of diffusion, we will start to see bunch of self-driving cars on streets.

what about regular cars? will they require a driver until last one of them (except antique collections) dumped? I believe time will come where human drivers will feel social pressure since they make mistakes on roads where self-driver cars dont. It is even possible to see days where new-gen blame laggers to not acquire self-driving cars and create risk factor for society on streets.

In technological aspect, dumping all cars is not efficient way for technology. We should consider to develop an efficient conversion for regular manual cars into self-driving ones. So peoples will acquire and implement only a kit to convert their old car erather than waiting high-tech cars price drop.

Mechanism is not impossible to dream or even sketch. Steering, pedals, gear, panel, and sensory system implementation will be enouggh to replace monkeys. Especially automatic gearing cars, orelectronic steering cars which became &#8220;regular&#8221; for last few years is way easier for implementation of this kit idea.

&nbsp;Actually there are some developments you can acquire for under $1000 if your car is quite high-tech for todays standarts.

What I&#8217;m sure is, self-driving car implementation will be valuable for taxis to increase their passenger capacity rather than paaying human driver salary. This goes for busses and many other form of public transportation ehich is quite popular topic in agenda of researches and developers.

Any regular person like me who hates driving car and believes that most of accidents are caused by human distraction or ego, will favor for suchkit rather than being lagger too.

Even in this video you can see how much traffic can speed up and get better if utopically all cars get self-driving car, and especially when they start to communicate with eachother with no human interference. Actually that video explains why future technology will drive cars way better than humans, like they do math, and control many other devices.
