> Apple was my final senior year film project.  
> The film was shot in two days, luckily that is, since we constantly trying to avoid an approaching storm.
> 
> The film has many scenes that I had wanted to include, but unfortunately couldn&#8217;t, considering the fact the we were on borrowed time, shooting with only one battery, we had to somewhat summarize, and cutdown, the aesthetics where it wouldn&#8217;t hurt the film as a whole.

> APPLE is mainly (and obviously) a symbolic film, like many of the previous films that I had made (in and out of school) were of the same nature as well, but dealt with a different topic/issue, however, had the same approach, which is: minimal explanation&#8230; its open for interpretation, often people had shared with me what they had thought about it, and seldom was it not something interesting.
