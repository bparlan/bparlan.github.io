  Actually it&#8217;s not a game, it&#8217;s a toy. No score, no competition. Player is a &#8220;falling star&#8221; through a coloful vortex with leaving trace in universe. After 10 falling, there is a sweet suprise waitin for the player. We hope everyone enjoys with the toy we produce within 48 hours. Just with last minute improvements, there is some sort of camera errors, but generally it&#8217;s done. Uploading the real &#8220;thing&#8221; what we dreamed in first second of &#8220;universe and eternity&#8221; idea bring to us.

      It is snake eating its own tail. It is also the symbol of Eternity, Cycle of life,death and rebirth and also the galaxies. Our game presents the idea of a ray trail that comes back to its tail, The idea of infinity and the galaxy.
