Whole script:

> And every one of us when we go into the psychedelic state, this is what we should be looking for. It&#8217;s not for your elucidation, it&#8217;s not part of your self-directed psychotherapy. You are an explorer, and you represent our species, and the greatest good you can do, is to bring back a new idea, because our world is in danger by the absence of good ideas. Our world is in crisis because of the absence of consciousness. And so to whatever degree any one of us, can bring back a small piece of the picture and contribute it to the building to the new paradigm, then we participate in the redemption of the human spirit, and that after all it what it&#8217;s really all about.
